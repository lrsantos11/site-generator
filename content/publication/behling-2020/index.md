abstract: The ancient concept of circumcenter has recently given birth to the Circumcentered-Reflection
  method (CRM). CRM was firstly employed to solve best approximation problems involving
  affine subspaces. In this setting, it was shown to outperform the most prestigious
  projection based schemes, namely, the Douglas-Rachford method (DRM) and the method
  of alternating projections (MAP). We now prove convergence of CRM for finding a
  point in the intersection of a finite number of closed convex sets. This striking
  result is derived under a suitable product space reformulation in which a point
  in the intersection of a closed convex set with an affine subspace is sought. It
  turns out that CRM skillfully tackles the reformulated problem. We also show that
  for a point in the affine set the CRM iteration is always closer to the solution
  set than both the MAP and DRM iterations. Our theoretical results and numerical
  experiments, showing outstanding performance, establish CRM as a powerful tool for
  solving general convex feasibility problems.
