abstract: We introduce and study a geometric modification of the Douglas– Rachford
  method called the Circumcentered– Douglas– Rachford method. This method iterates
  by taking the intersection of bisectors of reflection steps for solving certain
  classes of feasibility problems. The convergence analysis is established for best
  approximation problems involving two (affine) subspaces and both our theoretical
  and numerical results compare favorably to the original Douglas– Rachford method.
  Under suitable conditions, it is shown that the linear rate of convergence of the
  Circumcentered– Douglas– Rachford method is at least the cosine of the Friedrichs
  angle between the (affine) subspaces, which is known to be the sharp rate for the
  Douglas– Rachford method. We also present a preliminary discussion on the Circumcentered–
  Douglas– Rachford method applied to the many set case and to examples featuring
  non-affine convex sets.
