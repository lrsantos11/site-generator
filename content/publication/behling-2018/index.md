abstract: In order to accelerate the Douglasâ€“ Rachford method we recently developed
  the circumcentered-reflection method, which provides the closest iterate to the
  solution among all points relying on successive reflections, for the best approximation
  problem related to two affine subspaces. We now prove that this is still the case
  when considering a family of finitely many affine subspaces. This property yields
  linear convergence and incites embedding of circumcenters within classical reflection
  and projection based methods for more general feasibility problems.
