 abstract = {In order to accelerate the Douglasâ€“ Rachford method we recently developed the circumcentered-reflection method, which provides the closest iterate to the solution among all points relying on successive reflections, for the best approximation problem related to two affine subspaces. We now prove that this is still the case when considering a family of finitely many affine subspaces. This property yields linear convergence and incites embedding of circumcenters within classical reflection and projection based methods for more general feasibility problems.},
